# Iris-Multiclassification-Shiny-App
Shiny app for classifying Species in Iris for STAT6969 Assignment 9

These are the files for a homework assignment in my Practical Data Science class from my Biostatistics program in which we had to create an R Shiny App
for multiclassification using the ubiquitous Iris data set. Much of this code is borrowed from the sample code our instructor provided. 

This was the first project I ever posted on my GitHub. Despite the lack of any polish, I am leaving it as proof that I can indeed create a Shiny app.
